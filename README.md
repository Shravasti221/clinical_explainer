# Clinical Decision Support Explainer

A model-agnostic pipeline for analyzing and explaining multiple-choice medical question answering models using LIME and SHAP.

## Overview
This project provides tools for processing and explaining predictions from medical multiple-choice question answering models. It is designed to work with the CasiMedicos-Arg dataset and various HuggingFace models fine-tuned for medical question answering.

## Dataset
**CasiMedicos-Arg**: A dataset of 558 clinical cases in multiple languages
  - 434 training cases
  - 63 validation cases
  - 125 test cases

Dataset Links:
- [CasiMedicos-Arg on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HiTZ/casimedicos-exp)

## Features
- Model-agnostic pipeline for multiple-choice medical QA
- Support for any HuggingFace multiple-choice model
- Detailed prediction outputs with confidence scores
- Memory-efficient processing using generators
- Explainability using LIME and SHAP with visualization
- Save and load explanations for later analysis


## Installation

Install required packages:
```python
pip install datasets transformers torch lime
```

## Usage
```python
from clinical_explainer.src.pipeline import Pipeline
from clinical_explainer.src.explainers import ExplainerType

# Initialize pipeline with LIME explainer
pipeline = Pipeline(
    model_name="RUI525/PubMedBERT-finetune-MedMCQA-w-context",
    explainer_types=[ExplainerType.LIME, ExplainerType.SHAP]
)
pipeline.setup()

# Process cases and get explanations
results = pipeline.process_dataset('validation', limit=10)

```

Example output:
```
